# Rust Development

This directory is where I compile all my work related to Rust, a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Here, you'll find foundational concepts and more advanced topics, reflecting my journey in mastering Rust programming.

## Structure

The content is organized as follows:

```
Copiar código
Rust/
├── README.md
├── exercises/
├── projects/
├── resources/
└── tests/

```

- **exercises/**: Solutions to exercises from the course, covering key Rust concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, ownership, and more.
- **projects/**: Larger projects where I apply Rust in practical scenarios, from simple CLI applications to more complex systems programs and applications that focus on concurrency, memory safety, and performance.
- **resources/**: Supplementary materials, including explanations, course notes, and examples provided by the instructor. This section contains detailed explanations and reference material to aid in the understanding of Rust’s unique features.
- **tests/**: Test scripts to validate the functionality and correctness of exercises and projects. These tests are essential for ensuring that my code is both reliable and follows best practices in Rust.

## Transition to a More Professional Workflow

While initial experiments may have been carried out in simpler environments or playgrounds, I've shifted to a more professional workflow using Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager. Cargo not only makes managing dependencies easier but also facilitates writing, testing, and building efficient Rust programs.

This transition is about embracing a more thorough and professional approach to development. With tests, exercises, and project-based learning integrated into my workflow, I ensure that my development process is comprehensive and adheres to best practices.

## Highlights

- **Thorough Exercise Solutions**: Detailed solutions with comments to reinforce key Rust concepts such as ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- **Practical Projects**: Applied Rust in various real-world projects, demonstrating a clear understanding of its performance and safety guarantees.
- **Focus on Testing**: Prioritized writing tests to validate that each project and exercise meets expectations, ensuring code reliability and correctness.
- **Curated Resources**: Compiled resources that are essential for mastering Rust, from course notes to additional readings and community resources.

## Next Steps

As I continue to grow in systems programming, this directory will be regularly updated with new exercises, projects, and tests. My goal is to expand my understanding of Rust and build more sophisticated systems and applications while adhering to best practices in the industry.
