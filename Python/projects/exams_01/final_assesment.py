# 1.4: Write a function that finds the longest subarray of integers that has a sum equal to zero.
# Return the subarray as a list.
#
# Example:
# Input: [1, 2, -3, 3, 4, -7, 2, 1]
# Output: [3, 4, -7]
#
# Considerations:
# - The solution should be efficient even for large arrays.

def longest_zero_sum_subarray(nums):
    pass



# 2.4: Implement an asynchronous web scraper that takes a list of URLs, fetches HTML content
# concurrently, and extracts all <h1> tags from each page.
#
# You can assume there's a function `async def fetch_html(url)` to fetch the HTML of a page.
# Your task is to implement `async def scrape_h1_tags(urls)` that returns a dictionary with URLs
# as keys and a list of <h1> tag texts as values.
#
# Considerations:
# - Handle potential exceptions (e.g., timeouts or missing <h1> tags).

async def scrape_h1_tags(urls):
    pass



# 3.4: Implement a producer-consumer model where the producer reads JSON data from a list of URLs
# and places the parsed JSON objects in a queue. The consumer reads each JSON object, processes
# it (e.g., extracts specific fields), and writes the processed data to a CSV file.
#
# Use multi-threading to simulate concurrent data processing.
#
# Considerations:
# - Ensure that the consumer stops once all data has been processed.
