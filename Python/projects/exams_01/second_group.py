# 2.1: Implement a function that fetches data asynchronously for a list of URLs.
# You can assume there's a provided function `async def fetch_url(url)` that retrieves data from a URL.
# Your task is to write `async def fetch_all_urls(urls)` to fetch data from all URLs concurrently.
#
# Example:
# Input: ["http://example.com/1", "http://example.com/2"]
# Output: [{"url": "http://example.com/1", "data": ...}, {"url": "http://example.com/2", "data": ...}]
#
# Considerations:
# - Handle potential exceptions during the fetch process for individual URLs.

async def fetch_all_urls(urls):
    pass


# 2.2: Write an asynchronous function that simulates a simple chat client where multiple users
# send messages to a chatroom. Each user should be represented as a coroutine sending a message
# to a shared list of messages every few seconds.
#
# You should implement `async def chat_user(username, messages, duration)` that adds a message from
# `username` to the `messages` list every `duration` seconds. Create a function `async def run_chat(users)`
# that runs multiple chat_user coroutines concurrently.
#
# Example:
# Input: users = [("Alice", 2), ("Bob", 3)]
# Output: A chat log where Alice sends a message every 2 seconds and Bob every 3 seconds.
#
# Considerations:
# - Limit the chat to 10 messages in total for simplicity.

async def chat_user(username, messages, duration):
    pass

async def run_chat(users):
    pass


# 2.3: Implement an asynchronous function that reads and processes multiple files concurrently.
# You can assume there's a function `async def read_file(file_path)` that reads the content of a file.
# Your task is to write `async def read_all_files(file_paths)` that reads all files concurrently
# and returns the combined content of all files.
#
# Example:
# Input: ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]
# Output: Combined content of "file1.txt" and "file2.txt"
#
# Considerations:
# - Ensure that any file reading errors are handled gracefully.

async def read_all_files(file_paths):
    pass
