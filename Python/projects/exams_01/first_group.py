# 1.1: Implement a function that receives a list of strings and returns the longest common prefix.
# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string.
#
# Example:
# Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
# Output: "fl"
#
# Considerations:
# - The function should be efficient in handling long lists with varying string lengths.

def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    pass


# 1.2: Given a list of integers, implement a function that finds all unique triplets (a, b, c)
# such that a + b + c = 0.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
# Output: [[-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2]]
#
# Considerations:
# - Avoid duplicate triplets.
# - The function should be optimized for large lists.

def find_triplets(nums):
    pass


# 1.3: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the product of the maximum
# and minimum integers in the list. You cannot use the built-in min() or max() functions.
#
# Example:
# Input: [1, -3, 4, 2, -1]
# Output: -3 (product of -3 and 1)
#
# Considerations:
# - Ensure that the solution handles both positive and negative numbers.

def max_min_product(nums):
    pass
