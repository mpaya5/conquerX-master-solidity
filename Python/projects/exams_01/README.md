# Python Practice Exams

## Overview
This repository contains a set of Python practice exams designed to help improve and evaluate my Python programming skills. The exercises cover various aspects of Python development, including data manipulation, asynchronous programming, and multi-threading concepts.

These exercises are intended as a personal tool to challenge myself, gain deeper knowledge, and refine my problem-solving skills in Python.

## Structure
The exams are organized into three main categories, each focusing on a different aspect of Python:

1. **Data Manipulation and Optimization**: Exercises that test problem-solving skills, algorithm design, and efficiency in handling data structures.
2. **Asynchronous Programming**: Exercises that focus on handling I/O-bound tasks using Python's `asyncio` library, allowing efficient task management.
3. **Producer-Consumer Model with Multithreading**: Exercises that simulate real-world scenarios requiring multi-threading and communication between concurrent processes.

Each category contains multiple questions of varying difficulty, allowing for a comprehensive review of the respective concepts.

## Purpose
The purpose of these exams is purely educational and self-assessment. They serve as a tool for improving my understanding of advanced Python concepts, especially in preparation for opportunities where these skills are valuable.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the different exercises and attempt to solve them. Each question is designed to be challenging, but working through them will help deepen your understanding of Python and its capabilities.

## Disclaimer
These exams are intended for personal use only as a way to practice and enhance my Python skills. They are not associated with any external job application process or professional assessment.
