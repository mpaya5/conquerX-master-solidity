Optimal Network Routing Scenario
Important Note: While the scenario and task descriptions below use Python syntax for
illustration, please solve this challenge in the language specified by the recruiter or as per
the requirements of the coding test.
Scenario: In the intricate web of a cyberpunk city's data network, the swift and efficient routing
of data is crucial. The city's network is a vast maze of routers and data links, each with its own
latency. A unique feature of this network is the ability of certain nodes to compress data, halving
the latency of outgoing links from these nodes. This feature can be used only once per data
path.
As a skilled netrunner, you are tasked with developing an algorithm that navigates this complex
network, finding the path between two nodes that minimizes the total latency, taking into
consideration the data compression capabilities of specific routers.
Task: Implement a function, find_minimum_latency_path , that determines the path with the
lowest total latency between a source and destination router, accounting for possible data
compression at certain nodes.
Input:

Expected Output:

Constraints:
graph : A representation of the network as a map or dictionary, where each key is a router
ID and its value is a list of tuples representing connected routers and the latency of the
connection.
compression_nodes : A list or array of router IDs where data compression can be applied.
source : The ID of the source router.
destination : The ID of the destination router.

An integer representing the minimum total latency from the source router to the destination
router.

Solve this challenge in the specified programming language without relying on external
libraries for the core logic.
The solution should efficiently handle a complex network graph with multiple routers and
connections.

Example:

Evaluation Criteria:
# your implementation of the find_minimum_latency_path function
graph = {
'A': [('B', 10), ('C', 20)],
'B': [('D', 15)],
'C': [('D', 30)],
'D': []
}
compression_nodes = ['B', 'C']
source = 'A'
target = 'D'
min_latency = find_minimum_latency_path(graph, compression_nodes, source,
target)
print(f"Minimum total latency: {min_latency}")

Algorithmic Efficiency: Your algorithm should efficiently navigate the network, optimizing
for minimum latency.
Correctness: The calculated minimum total latency must accurately reflect the most
efficient path, considering data compression capabilities.
Code Quality: The code should be clear, well-organized, and adhere to best coding
practices.
Edge Case Handling: The solution should robustly handle various network topologies,
including large graphs and edge cases like unavailable paths.
