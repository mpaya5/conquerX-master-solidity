## Example Exercise

**Build a smart contract simulating a Bank**

### Variables

- A list where we save the balance of an account with address and amount.

### Functions

- A function to add balance to their own account.
- A function to return their own balance.
- A function to transfer balance between accounts (address): 
    - Inside function to transfer balance with 3 parÃ¡meters: the receiver, the sender, the amount.
