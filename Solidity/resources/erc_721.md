# ERC-721 Token 

## What is an ERC-721 Token?

- **ERC-721** is a standard for **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Unlike ERC-20 tokens, which are **fungible** (each token is identical), ERC-721 tokens are **unique** and **non-interchangeable**.
- ERC-721 tokens are used to represent **digital assets** such as digital art, virtual real estate, and game characters.
- These tokens can be **bought, sold, and transferred** using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Key Imports in ERC-721

### ERC165

- **ERC-165** is an Ethereum standard that allows contracts to check if they support a particular interface.
- This standard helps contracts ensure interoperability by safely verifying if they implement a required interface without running all the interface functions.

### IERC165 Interface

- Implements the ERC165 standard. It defines a method for other contracts to query support for a given interface.

### IERC721 Interface

- Defines the main functionality that all ERC-721 token contracts must implement. This interface includes essential functions like `balanceOf()`, `ownerOf()`, `approve()`, `transferFrom()`, and more.

## Variables in ERC-721

1. **Token Name and Symbol**:
    - ERC-721 contracts store a **name** and a **symbol** for the token collection.
    - Example:
    
    ```solidity
    string private _name;
    string private _symbol;
    
    function name() public view returns (string memory) {
        return _name;
    }
    
    function symbol() public view returns (string memory) {
        return _symbol;
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Mapping Token Ownership**:
    - A mapping that links each **unique token ID** (`uint256`) to its **owner's address**.
    - Another mapping tracks the **balance** of tokens an address owns.
    
    ```solidity
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _owners;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _balances;
    
    ```
    
3. **Approved Operators and Token Spend Delegation**:
    - A mapping that stores **approved spenders** of tokens and **operators** authorized to manage all tokens for an owner.
    
    ```solidity
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    
    ```
    

## Key Functions in ERC-721

### Constructor

- When deploying an ERC-721 contract, the **constructor** assigns a name and symbol to the token collection.

### `balanceOf()` and `ownerOf()`

- **`balanceOf(address owner)`**: Returns the number of tokens held by a specific address.
- **`ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`**: Returns the owner of a given token ID.

```solidity
function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256) {
    return _balances[owner];
}

function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address) {
    return _owners[tokenId];
}

```

### `approve()` and `getApproved()`

- **`approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Grants permission to `to` to manage the token with the specified `tokenId`.
- **`getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`**: Returns the address approved to manage a given token.

```solidity
function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
    address owner = ownerOf(tokenId);
    require(to != owner, "ERC721: approval to current owner");
    require(msg.sender == owner, "ERC721: approve caller is not owner");

    _tokenApprovals[tokenId] = to;
}

```

### `transferFrom()` and `safeTransferFrom()`

- **`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Transfers ownership of a token from `from` to `to`.
- **`safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Similar to `transferFrom()`, but ensures the recipient is capable of handling ERC-721 tokens by calling `_checkOnERC721Received()`.

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
    require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId), "ERC721: transfer caller is not owner nor approved");
    _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
}

```

## Internal Functions

### `_transfer()`

- Handles the logic for transferring tokens from one address to another.
- It updates the mappings for ownership, clears the approvals for the token, and adjusts the balances.

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal {
    require(ownerOf(tokenId) == from, "ERC721: transfer of token that is not own");
    require(to != address(0), "ERC721: transfer to the zero address");

    _beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);

    _balances[from] -= 1;
    _balances[to] += 1;
    _owners[tokenId] = to;
}

```

### `_safeTransfer()`

- Calls `_transfer()` and then ensures the recipient contract implements `onERC721Received()`.

```solidity
function _safeTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal {
    _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    require(_checkOnERC721Received(from, to, tokenId), "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver");
}

```

### `_mint()` and `_burn()`

- **`_mint(address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Creates a new token and assigns it to `to`, provided `tokenId` is unique and does not already exist.
- **`_burn(uint256 tokenId)`**: Destroys the token, removing it from the mappings and clearing any approvals.

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC721: mint to the zero address");
    require(!_exists(tokenId), "ERC721: token already minted");

    _balances[to] += 1;
    _owners[tokenId] = to;
}

function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal {
    address owner = ownerOf(tokenId);

    _balances[owner] -= 1;
    delete _owners[tokenId];
    delete _tokenApprovals[tokenId];
}

```

### `_checkOnERC721Received()`

- Ensures that contracts receiving ERC-721 tokens implement the necessary function to handle them.

```solidity
function _checkOnERC721Received(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) private returns (bool) {
    if (to.isContract()) {
        try IERC721Receiver(to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, from, tokenId) returns (bytes4 retval) {
            return retval == IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;
        } catch (bytes memory) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

```
