# Blockchain and FullStack Development Studies

This repository contains my work from various modules in Blockchain Development and FullStack Development, primarily focusing on areas that I find most valuable for my career advancement. The content includes exercises, projects, and study materials for specific topics where I aim to deepen my knowledge and skills.

## Modules Included

Currently, this repository features the following modules:

- **Solidity**: Exercises, projects, and resources related to Solidity, the primary language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

I have chosen to focus on advanced and relevant topics that align with my professional goals. Therefore, some basic modules like Python Fundamentals, HTML, and CSS, which I consider to be outside the scope of my current objectives, are not included.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of my work:
```
blockchain-master/
├── README.md
└── Solidity/
    ├── exercises/
    ├── projects/
    └── resources/
```

  - **Solidity**: This folder contains all my work related to Solidity, including:
  - **exercises/**: Solutions to exercises provided in the course.
  - **projects/**: Larger projects or final assignments demonstrating the application of Solidity in real-world scenarios.
  - **resources/**: Additional materials such as notes, links, and documentation that support the learning process.

## Future Additions

As I continue my studies, I will be selectively adding more content from other modules that are relevant to my goals, such as advanced JavaScript frameworks, backend development with Node.js, and other blockchain-related technologies.
